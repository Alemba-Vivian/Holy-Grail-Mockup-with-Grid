Hints
For this exercise you will need to add some CSS declaration blocks to the style.css file. Look through the HTML to see what selectors and combinators you can use.
Take the layout one section at a time
You don't need to add or change anything to the HTML, but it will be helpful to look through the parent and child relationships between elements
